The Midi Jukebox in Theme Hospital lets you play all the midi tunes
that come with the game. However, it is also possible to play your own
midi compositions.

Simply copy your midi file (example.mid) to the installed Hospital
directory on your hard drive and type:-

                HOSPMIDI example

(NB Do not type the .mid extension)

You should now be able to see your midi composition in the Theme Hospital
Jukebox when you play the game.
