Network / Serial / Modem games
==============================

You have a choice between IPX, Serial and Modem connections - you also have a direct play IPX 
function on the Windows '95 version (called DPLAYIPX in the game) this is a Windows '95 only 
version and dplayipx computers can only play against dplayipx computers. It utilises the direct 
play drivers of Direct X and can therefore only be played in Windows '95. 

Note - Windows '95, not Windows (2 or 3 or 3.11)

There are major differences in the game when playing against opponents. As well as competing 
with other Hospitals - all together on the same map, of course - you can turn aggressive, throwing 
litter bombs from Hospital to Hospital. There is also no Build Time clock, it gets hectic from Day 
One

Theme Hospital can support multi-player games in three ways. To set up or take part in a network 
game of any kind, players must select the NET option from the [Game Selection Screen].

IPX Network
-----------
Left click on [IPX]. Then one player must left click on [Create Game] to start a game. Other 
players who wish to take part in the same game must left click on the session name, using the 
scroll arrows to move up and down if necessary, and then left click on [Join Session].
To leave a session, left click on [Quit Session].
To send messages before the game starts, just type your message. It appears in the text box as 
you type. To send it, press Enter or left click on the [Talk] button next to the text box. Your 
message will be displayed to all players in their message box above the text box.
Next, there is a choice of five levels in multi-player mode. These automatically cater for 2-4 
players and, once one is selected, the game can begin.

Serial
------
Connect the serial cable to both machines. Both players must left click on [NET] at the [Game 
Selection Screen], and select [Serial]. They must then select the correct COM port from the list 
towards the top right of the screen (COM 1-4 are listed as options). They must also both select 
which speed they wish to play at. The speed must be the same for both machines.
One player then left clicks on [Create Session]. Then the other player may select [Join 
Session]. The players should then be able to talk to each other by typing text and pressing Enter, 
as described above in IPX NETWORK.
The player who created the game can then left click [Start Session] to begin play. Note that the 
levels available automatically cater for two players.

Modem
-----
Both players must left click on [NET] at the [Game Selection Screen], and select [Modem]. They 
must both then choose the correct COM port supporting their modems from the list on the top 
right, and select the Baud Rate [Speed]. This must be the same for both machines.
One player must then left click on [Number] and enter the telephone number of the other player, 
and left click on the plus sign (+)]. The number appears in the box towards the top of the screen. 
The creating player must left click on [Dial]. The second machine produces a bleep and the 
second player should left click on [Answer]. If no connection is made, the first player must re-try, 
checking that all the details are correctly set by both players.
Once the connection is established, the players are able to type messages and press Enter to talk 
to each other. Successful connection will result in a session automatically being created.
The dialling player can then left click [Start Session] to begin play. Note that the levels available 
automatically cater for two players.


Features Of The Network Game
----------------------------
All the players have Hospitals which appear on the same map.
Each player's Patients have their own colour (of jacket or coat) to distinguish them.

Litter Bombs:
------------
These are expensive items which, when bought and placed in other players' 
Hospitals, explode and spread large amounts of litter around. If the player whose Hospital the litter 
bomb is planted in spots it before it detonates, he or she may pick it up and plant it in another 
Hospital. Speed and vigilance are the watchwords here.
LITTER BOMBS CANNOT BE SOLD ONCE BOUGHT OR PICKED UP! YOU MUST PLACE 
THEM SOMEWHERE TO REMOVE THEM FROM THE CURSOR!

Buying Plots:
------------
If a player wishes to buy a plot of land, all players automatically go to the [bidding 
screen]. Any player can then make a bid by left clicking on the Tick button. The player who 
originally wished to buy the plot starts off the bidding. When the hammer falls, the plot is assigned 
to the highest bidder.

Poaching Staff:
--------------
To poach another player's Staff, left click on the Staff member you wish to 
poach and the Advisor will ask that Staff member if he'd prefer to work for you. If the Staff member 
becomes unhappy, he makes an outrageous pay demand of his current employer. If this is not 
met, the member of Staff resigns his post and joins your Hospital automatically.

Talking To Other Players:
------------------------
To converse with other players in the game, first ascertain which player is assigned to which ALT 
number. This is done by pressing ALT 1, 2, or 3 and seeing which player's nickname appears in 
the transparent text box. Even if you have entered text, you can still swap between receivers the 
ALT plus the number keys. The text remains in the transparent box while you do this.
Press ALT 4 to speak to all the other players in the game.

Referrals:
---------
You can refer Patients to other Hospitals by using the [Patient Redirection Panel]. Refer to Part 2 
of the manual for further details.

Mini Missions:
-------------
During a Network game, players may get specific instructions to carry out. An example is, [`Accept 
an Emergency in the next six months or you will lose the game.'] These instructions vary and are 
self-explanatory.

Emergencies & VIP Visits:
------------------------
Each Emergency and VIP visit happens to all players simultaneously. The first player to left click 
acceptance of the Emergency or visit will receive it. It's a `first-come, first-served' system and 
rewards the vigilant player.
