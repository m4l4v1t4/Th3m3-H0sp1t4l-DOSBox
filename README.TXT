Theme Hospital ReadMe.txt
_________________________


There are two major upgrades in this patch:

1) We've added easy and hard difficulty levels for the single player game.

2)  We've added a multiplayer option, with modem, serial and IPX support.
See the separate file, netplay.txt, for details of these.


We have also fixed a few bugs that we have found since we released the game:


1) There was a problem with surgeons, psychiatrists and researchers that you
train up in the training room. If you sacked them, you might lose the ability
to cure diseases that they handled, even if you had some more of those staff
types left.  This particularly affected level 5, where a lot of training was
involved.

2) Running Hospital without a CD in the drive on a DOS machine no longer
results in Abort/Retry/Fail messages.

3) There were some cases where doctors' and patients' heads and limbs could
disappear!  This should	no longer happen.

4) There were some cases of the advisor giving confusing advice, and a few
end-of-year trophies given to undeserving hospitals.

5) We also fixed a lot of small problems that are too minor to mention here!


If you have any further difficulties with the game please feel free to contact
